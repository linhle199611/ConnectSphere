# ConectSphere

ConnectSphere is a decentralized chat app with the frontend build with Svelte and backend is built with [GUN](https://gun.eco/) and AWS Lambda and DynamoDB. This project implement three distriuted system algorithms: leader election, broadcast, and timestamp. Through Gun.js, ConnectSphere is a peer to peer network where peers can receive or propagate messages to one another and this is also how data stored. So, the ConnectSphere's database is all the peers in the network unified because all the peers have their own data that they are subscribed to.
